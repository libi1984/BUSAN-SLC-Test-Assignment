# BUSAN-SLC-Test-Assignment
#The aim of this Script is to visualize a single-look-complex (SLC) dataset of Busan Harbor collected #by one of Synspectiveâ€™s Strix satellites. 
#This scripts opens SLC data set, performs filtering using Hanning window and save the original and processed plots in Folder

 #How to run the script
#Download and save the data in Folder "SLC_Folder" in same directory
#Create a folder "Saved_plots" in same directory
#Run the script
##Process Flow
     -The range-azimuth data read from SLC data
     -Converting data from Time domain to Frequency Domain
     -Shifting the frequency spectrum centered with zero frequency
     -Filtering using Hanning Window
     -Inverse FFT 
     -Plot the data and analyse the result
#The Original and Post processed images will be save in Folder    "Saved_plots". One plot shows the Original and Post processed datain entire range and azimuth. Second plot shows the zoomed data for Busan Harbor
