# BUSAN-SLC-Test-Assignment
#The aim of this Script is to visualize a single-look-complex (SLC) dataset of Busan Harbor collected #by one of Synspectiveâ€™s Strix satellites. 
#This scripts opens SLC data set, performs filtering using Hanning window and save the original and processed plots in Folder

##Process Flow
     -The range-azimuth data read from SLC data
     -Converting data from Time domain to Frequency Domain
     -Shifting the frequency spectrum centered with zero frequency
     -Filtering using Hanning Window
     -Inverse FFT 
     -Plot the data and analyse the result
